** TODO Change equality check for posts

   Currently we do some shenanigans in the generator to avoid issues when checking equality. For
   example, we filter out dates within a day of `now` when posts have a status of future because we
   don't want the status to change while testing.

   We could simply take these things into account in our post conditions rather than checking for
   straight value equality.

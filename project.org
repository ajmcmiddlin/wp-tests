** TODO Work out why nixops errors out on deployment

    We want deployment to be fully automated. The dumb but easy thing to do would be to write a
    script that always reboots after running the first `deploy`, and then deploys again.

** TODO Query IP address

    Ideally we would query `nixops` to find out the IP of the deployed machine rather than manually
    entering it into a script.

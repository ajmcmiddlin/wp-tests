** TODO Change equality check for posts

   Currently we do some shenanigans in the generator to avoid issues when checking equality. For
   example, we filter out dates within a day of `now` when posts have a status of future because we
   don't want the status to change while testing.

   We could simply take these things into account in our post conditions rather than checking for
   straight value equality.

** TODO Work out why nixops errors out on deployment

    We want deployment to be fully automated. The dumb but easy thing to do would be to write a
    script that always reboots after running the first `deploy`, and then deploys again.

** TODO Query IP address

    Ideally we would query `nixops` to find out the IP of the deployed machine rather than manually
    entering it into a script.
